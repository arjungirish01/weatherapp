Weather Application in Python

Overview

This is a simple yet powerful Weather Application built using Python. The app provides real-time weather updates, forecasts, and additional environmental details for any location worldwide. It uses a clean and user-friendly interface to deliver weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Get current weather details for any city or geographic location.
5-Day Forecast: View weather predictions for the next five days.
Search Functionality: Easily search for cities or use GPS-based location detection (if enabled).
Detailed Insights: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and more.
Graphical Representation: View data through graphs or icons for better understanding (optional feature).
Error Handling: Displays meaningful messages for incorrect inputs or API errors.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for development.
Requests: To fetch data from weather APIs.
Weather API: Integration with APIs like OpenWeatherMap for fetching weather data.
How It Works
Enter a city name in the search bar or use the GPS-based locator to find your current weather.
The application queries the weather API and displays the relevant data.
View real-time data or switch to a 5-day forecast for planning.
Error handling ensures user-friendly messages are displayed for invalid inputs or network issues.
